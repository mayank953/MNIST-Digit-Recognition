<h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DIGIT RECOGNIZER- MNIST</strong></span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/0QI3xgXuB-Q/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Image result for MNIST" /></p>
<p>MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. A new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.</p>
<p>In this competition, the goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.</p>
<p>The competition is hosted on kaggle <a title="MNIST" href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Metric</h3>
<p>This competition is evaluated on the categorization accuracy of your predictions (the percentage of images you get correct).</p>

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>APPROACH</strong></span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this project, I have followed a down to the top approach wherein I have first applied very basic Machine learning algorithm without jumping to CNN. This would help one to understand why there arises a need of CNN &amp; how it is able to easily achieve a good accuracy with image dataset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SUBMISSION</strong></span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have uploaded my submission file in the submission folder.&nbsp;<br />Currently, I have achieved an accuracy of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>99.671</strong></span> &amp; stands in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>top 5%</strong></span> of all kaggle submission</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>CODE</strong></span></p>
<p>I have uploaded the code according to various approaches &amp; have tried to explain it wherever necessary.&nbsp;<br />MNIST is an excellent dataset for anyone looking to enter or practice the basic concept of computer vision &amp; deep learning.&nbsp;<br /><br />Further, I will work so as to apply an ensemble of various models so that I can achieve a higher accuracy &amp; will even try to use pre-trained models &amp; transfer learning.</p>
